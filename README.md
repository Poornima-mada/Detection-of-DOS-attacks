# Detection-of-DOS-attacks

##        An overview of my project


Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) comprise interconnected smart devices communicating wirelessly to collect and share data, playing a crucial role across various domains. However, they confront significant security challenges, particularly denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which disrupt normal operations. These attacks aim to render a network or device inaccessible to legitimate users by inundating it with excessive traffic or triggering system crashes. By exploiting vulnerabilities, attackers obstruct access to computer systems, networks, or services, posing serious threats to information technology resources. Prior approaches predominantly relied on decision trees (DT) to detect Dos attacks ,achieving around 92% accuracy but suffering from overfitting and susceptibility to noise and missing data. This project endeavors to address these limitations by leveraging alternative Machine Learning Algorithms like Navies Bayes, XGBoost, and RandomForest to bolster Dos attack detection performance in WSNs, enhancing security and resilience in these networks.
